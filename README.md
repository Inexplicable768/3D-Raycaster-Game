# 3D-Raycaster-Game
I made a complete 3D raycaster game using python. Feel free to download and have a play with it. It's a simple FPS game set in an egyptian pyriamaid where you solve puzzles and kill ghosts and mummies. I have more ideas for gameplay however i need to move beyond just raycasting for that
